# RaceMe

RaceMe is app where people connect through their phones and start sharing their location live using WebSockets.
The purpose of the app is street racing.

Once you find someone close to you (displeyed with geolocation map in the front end) you can challenge him and the app will pick random
place to which will the racers drive. The user that gets first into the desired location - wins.
-- they are going to be different mods that will be implemented in near future

Really basic frontend part just to try location sharing between 2 logged in users (using SSO fb,google,github)

App is still development process.
